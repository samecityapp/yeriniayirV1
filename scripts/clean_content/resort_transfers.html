<p><strong>Quick answer:</strong> For most UK travellers, a <strong>private transfer</strong> is the “sweet spot” for
    value: it costs only slightly more than a shared shuttle (for a family/group) but saves you 1–2 hours of drop-off
    loops. Shared shuttles are cheap but slow. Taxis are fine for short hops but can be variable on price. Renting a car
    just for the airport run is rarely worth the paperwork.</p>

<h2>The "Airport Stress" Trap (and how to avoid it)</h2>
<p>The biggest stress is landing, feeling the heat, wrangling tired kids/bags, and <em>then</em> trying to negotiate
    transport.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> If you are travelling with kids or landing after 9 pm, <strong>pre-book a private
        transfer</strong>. The extra £20 is worth avoiding the argument at the taxi rank.</p>

<h2>FAQ: UK Traveller Transfers</h2>

<h3>Do transfer drivers speak English?</h3>
<p>Usually basic "transport English". But they have WhatsApp and Google Translate. It’s rarely an issue.</p>

<h3>Do I tip the transfer driver?</h3>
<p>It's polite but not mandatory. 50–100 TL (or £2–£3) is appreciated for help with bags.</p>

<h3>What if my flight is delayed?</h3>
<p>If you gave your flight number, they track it. If it's a huge delay (4+ hours), message them on WhatsApp before you
    fly.</p>

<h3>Can I use Uber?</h3>
<p>Uber exists in Istanbul (calls yellow taxis) and some coastal spots, but it's not reliable for long
    <em>airport-to-resort</em> journeys. Stick to pre-booked transfers.</p>
