{"en":"<h1>Turkey City + Coast Itinerary (UK): How to Split Your Trip by Season</h1>\n\n<div style=\"border:1px solid #ddd;padding:16px;background:#f9f9f9;margin-bottom:20px\"><strong>Key Takeaways for UK Travellers</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple rule:</strong> July–August = mostly coast; April–May & late Sept–Oct = 50/50 city–coast; winter = city + Cappadocia or thermal/snow.</li>\n<li><strong>Fast combos:</strong> Istanbul + Antalya, Dalaman, Bodrum–Milas or Izmir via frequent domestic flights from Istanbul Airport (IST) and Sabiha Gökçen (SAW).</li>\n<li><strong>One-week trip:</strong> Typically 2–3 nights Istanbul (Sultanahmet/Karaköy area) + 4–5 nights coast (Antalya, Fethiye, Bodrum Peninsula).</li>\n<li><strong>10–12 days:</strong> Often 4 nights Istanbul + 2–3 nights Cappadocia + 4–5 nights Mediterranean or Aegean coast.</li>\n<li><strong>Local movement:</strong> Rely on dolmuş and trams: Antalya’s KL08 bus along Konyaaltı, Fethiye–Ölüdeniz minibuses from Fethiye Otogar, Bodrum peninsula dolmuş from Bodrum Otogar.</li>\n<li><strong>Costs (rough):</strong> Domestic flights often £25–£90 one way if booked early; intercity coaches like Istanbul Esenler → Izmir Otogar are usually similar to or less than many UK intercity train fares.</li>\n<li><strong>UK-friendly tip:</strong> Fix internal flights (e.g. Istanbul → Antalya, Istanbul → Kayseri) before locking in non‑refundable UK flights.</li>\n</ul></div>\n\n<p>If you are flying from the UK and want both Turkish cities and coast, aim for at least 7 days, usually start in Istanbul, then fly or bus to either the Mediterranean (Antalya, Kaş, Side) or Aegean (Bodrum Peninsula, Fethiye, Kuşadası). How you split your time depends mainly on the month.</p>\n\n<h2>How Many Days in City vs Coast?</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Simple rule:</strong> decide the split by season, then choose hubs that match your flights.</p>\n\n<h3>Typical Splits by Trip Length</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5 days (city focus, quick coast taste)</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Winter/early spring:</strong> 5 nights Istanbul around Sultanahmet, Sirkeci or Karaköy, with a Bosphorus cruise from Eminönü Pier.</li>\n    <li><strong>Summer:</strong> 2 nights Istanbul + 3 nights Antalya (base between Kaleiçi alleys such as Barbaros Caddesi and Konyaaltı promenade).</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>7 days</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Spring/autumn:</strong> 3 nights Istanbul + 2 nights Cappadocia (Göreme/Ürgüp) + 2 nights coast (Fethiye or Kaş).</li>\n    <li><strong>Summer:</strong> 2 nights Istanbul + 5 nights coast (Antalya/Konyaaltı, Side or Bodrum Peninsula).</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>10–12 days</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Spring/autumn:</strong> 4 nights Istanbul + 3 nights Cappadocia + 3–5 nights Mediterranean or Aegean.</li>\n    <li><strong>Summer:</strong> 3 nights Istanbul + 7–9 nights coast, splitting between a hub (Antalya or Bodrum town) and a smaller place like Kaş or Çalış.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>UK-friendly tip:</strong> On your first visit, avoid more than three different bases. It is usually smoother to pick <em>one</em> city and <em>one</em> coast base, or at most two coastal bases on the same road (for example Antalya → Kaş along the D400).</p>\n\n<h2>Best City + Coast Splits by Season</h2>\n\n<h3>Spring (April–May): 50/50 Culture and Coast</h3>\n\n<p>Daytime is comfortable for walking in Istanbul and Cappadocia, with first swims on the south coast by late April, especially near Antalya and Alanya.</p>\n\n<h4>Example 10-Day Spring Itinerary</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 1–4: Istanbul</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Base near <strong>Divanyolu Caddesi</strong> in Sultanahmet or around Karaköy tram stops.</li>\n    <li>Use the <strong>T1 tram</strong> from Kabataş through Karaköy and over Galata Bridge to Sultanahmet and Beyazıt.</li>\n    <li>Take an evening ferry from <strong>Eminönü İskelesi</strong> to <strong>Kadıköy</strong>; wander <strong>Bahariye Caddesi</strong> and the Moda waterfront.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 5–7: Cappadocia</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Fly Istanbul → <strong>Kayseri Erkilet</strong> or <strong>Nevşehir Kapadokya</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Stay near <strong>Göreme Otogar</strong> for easy access to minibuses to Avanos and Ürgüp.</li>\n    <li>Walk Pigeon Valley from <strong>Uçhisar</strong> towards Göreme; visit open-air sites such as Paşabağ and Zelve.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 8–10: Coast – Fethiye or Kaş</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Fly via Istanbul to <strong>Dalaman Airport</strong> (for Fethiye) or to <strong>Antalya</strong> (for Kaş via bus).</li>\n    <li>For Fethiye: shuttle or dolmuş from Dalaman to <strong>Fethiye Otogar</strong>, then stroll down <strong>Atatürk Caddesi</strong> and the marina.</li>\n    <li>Dolmuş from Fethiye town to <strong>Ölüdeniz</strong> and <strong>Hisarönü</strong> leave from stands close to the main road near the Otogar.</li>\n    <li>For Kaş: bus from Fethiye or Antalya along the D400 via Kalkan to <strong>Kaş Otogar</strong>, then explore <strong>Uzun Çarşı Sokak</strong> and the harbour.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"border-left:4px solid #0074D9;padding:10px 12px;margin:16px 0\"><strong>Local insight – Spring:</strong> Sea around Fethiye and Kaş can still feel cool in April. Many visitors focus on short Lycian Way walks above Faralya and around Kayaköy rather than full beach days.</div>\n\n<h3>Summer (June–September): Mostly Coast, Short City Stays</h3>\n\n<p>July–August are hot, especially inland. Plan early‑morning city sightseeing and long afternoons by the sea.</p>\n\n<h4>Example 10-Day Summer Itinerary</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 1–2: Istanbul (quick highlights)</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Stay near tram/metro – for example around Karaköy or along <strong>Yerebatan Caddesi</strong> in Sultanahmet.</li>\n    <li>Visit main historic sights early, then cool off in Gülhane Park or on a Bosphorus ferry.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 3–7: Antalya Region</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Fly Istanbul → <strong>Antalya Airport</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Use the tram from <strong>Antalya Havalimanı</strong> stop to reach the centre or <strong>HAVAİŞ</strong> shuttle to <strong>Antalya Otogar</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Split time between:\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Kaleiçi</strong>: cobbled streets such as <strong>Barbaros Caddesi</strong>, small beach at Mermerli, marina views.</li>\n        <li><strong>Konyaaltı Beach</strong>: long seafront with cycle path; buses like <strong>KL08</strong> run parallel to the shore.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Side trip ideas:\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Side:</strong> coach Antalya Otogar → Manavgat, then local minibus marked \"Side\" to the ruins and beaches.</li>\n        <li><strong>Çıralı/Olympos:</strong> buses along the D400 (Antalya–Kumluca–Kaş) drop at the Olympos/Çıralı junction; continue by dolmuş down to the shore.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 8–10: Smaller Town – Kaş or Kalkan</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>From Antalya Otogar take a D400 bus through Kemer, Finike and Demre to <strong>Kaş</strong> or <strong>Kalkan</strong>.</li>\n    <li>In Kaş, swimming platforms and small pebbly beaches sit a short walk from the main square and harbour.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"border-left:4px solid #FF851B;padding:10px 12px;margin:16px 0\"><strong>Local insight – Summer:</strong> Buy an <strong>AntalyaKart</strong> from kiosks near tram stops to use trams and buses like KL08 and LC07 cheaply along Konyaaltı and to the city centre.</div>\n\n<p>For more on neighbourhoods, see <a href=\"[INTERNAL_LINK:antalya-region-guide]\">Antalya coast area guide for UK visitors</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Autumn (September–October): Warm Sea, Softer Sun</h3>\n\n<p>Sea is usually still warm on Konyaaltı, Ölüdeniz Lagoon and around Bodrum, but air temperatures are easier for city walking.</p>\n\n<h4>Example 12-Day Autumn Itinerary</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 1–4: Istanbul</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Walk <strong>Istiklal Caddesi</strong> from Taksim to Tünel, turning into Cihangir side streets and <strong>Serdar-ı Ekrem Sokak</strong> near Galata.</li>\n    <li>Evening ferries Kadıköy ↔ Karaköy/Beşiktaş are pleasant in cooler air.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 5–8: Cappadocia</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Hike from Uçhisar down Pigeon Valley towards Göreme; autumn light is good for photography.</li>\n    <li>Use minibuses from Göreme Otogar to Avanos (pottery) and Ürgüp.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 9–12: Aegean Coast – Bodrum Peninsula</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Fly Kayseri/Nevşehir → <strong>Bodrum–Milas Airport</strong> (often via Istanbul; check current routes).</li>\n    <li>HAVAŞ shuttle to <strong>Bodrum Otogar</strong> on Cafer Paşa Caddesi.</li>\n    <li>Use dolmuş from Bodrum Otogar to <strong>Bitez</strong>, <strong>Gümbet</strong>, <strong>Yalıkavak</strong>, <strong>Gündoğan</strong> or <strong>Gümüşlük</strong>.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"border-left:4px solid #2ECC40;padding:10px 12px;margin:16px 0\"><strong>Local insight – Autumn:</strong> Early October evenings on Bodrum’s Atatürk Caddesi and the marina promenade stay lively but not overwhelming, and the sea is often swimmable well into the month.</div>\n\n<p>For coastline comparisons, see <a href=\"[INTERNAL_LINK:aegean-vs-mediterranean-coast]\">Aegean vs Mediterranean coast in Turkey</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Winter (November–March): City, Cappadocia and Thermal or Snow</h3>\n\n<p>Most smaller coastal towns (Kaş, Kalkan, Ölüdeniz) are quiet and partly seasonal. Focus on Istanbul, Cappadocia and either thermal pools or a ski area.</p>\n\n<h4>Example 8–9 Day Winter Itinerary</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 1–4: Istanbul</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Stay near tram/metro – for example along <strong>Ordu Caddesi</strong> (Laleli/Beyazıt) or around Karaköy.</li>\n    <li>Warm up with <strong>mercimek çorbası</strong> (lentil soup) and breads like <strong>simit</strong> and <strong>pide</strong> from bakeries along Fevzi Paşa Caddesi and side streets.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 5–6: Cappadocia</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Istanbul → Kayseri/Nevşehir flight; expect possible snow around Paşabağ and Çavuşin.</li>\n    <li>Paths can be icy – pack footwear with good grip and layers.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Days 7–8/9: Thermal or Snow</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Pamukkale & Karahayıt (thermal):</strong> bus via <strong>Denizli Otogar</strong>, then minibus labelled Pamukkale. Walk up travertine terraces and visit red‑water thermal facilities in Karahayıt.</li>\n    <li><strong>Uludağ (ski/snow, via Bursa):</strong> bus Istanbul Esenler Otogar → Bursa Otogar, then local bus to <strong>Teferrüç Teleferik İstasyonu</strong> and cable car into Uludağ.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"border-left:4px solid #85144b;padding:10px 12px;margin:16px 0\"><strong>Local insight – Winter:</strong> Domestic flight schedules (for example Istanbul → Denizli or Istanbul → Nevşehir) can be thinner than in summer. Check times first, then build the rest of the itinerary.</div>\n\n<h2>Choosing Your Bases: Cities and Coasts That Connect Well</h2>\n\n<h3>Istanbul: Main Hub from the UK</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best areas for a short stay:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Sultanahmet/Sirkeci:</strong> walking access to main sights via Divanyolu Caddesi; on tram line T1.</li>\n    <li><strong>Karaköy/Galata:</strong> close to Galata Bridge and Istiklal Caddesi; linked by tram and the short Karaköy–Beyoğlu funicular.</li>\n    <li><strong>Kadıköy:</strong> Asian‑side base with ferries to Eminönü and Beşiktaş, streets like <strong>Moda Caddesi</strong> and Bahariye Caddesi for cafés and bars.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Key onward links:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>IST/SAW → Antalya (AYT) for Antalya city, Side, Alanya, Kaş/Kalkan (via bus).</li>\n    <li>IST/SAW → Dalaman (DLM) for Fethiye, Ölüdeniz, Dalyan, Marmaris (via D400 road).</li>\n    <li>IST/SAW → Bodrum–Milas (BJV) for Bodrum Peninsula bays.</li>\n    <li>IST/SAW → Izmir (ADB) for Çeşme, Alaçatı, Kuşadası and Selçuk (Ephesus).</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Other Handy City Bases</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Izmir:</strong> Stay around the <strong>Kordon</strong> and <strong>Alsancak</strong>, strolling <strong>Kıbrıs Şehitleri Caddesi</strong>. Buses from Izmir Otogar reach Çeşme, Alaçatı, Kuşadası and Selçuk.</li>\n<li><strong>Bursa:</strong> Accessible from Istanbul by bus from Esenler Otogar or by ferry across the Sea of Marmara; good for combining an Ottoman‑era city with Uludağ in winter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Mediterranean vs Aegean Coast – Which with Istanbul?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mediterranean (Antalya, Side, Alanya, Kaş/Kalkan)</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Earlier and longer swimming season; warm seas often from late April to October.</li>\n    <li>Scenic D400 road runs Antalya → Kemer → Finike → Demre → Kaş → Kalkan.</li>\n    <li>Historical sites like Perge and Aspendos reachable as day trips from Antalya.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Aegean (Bodrum, Fethiye, Kuşadası, Çeşme)</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Strong sailing and gulet culture, especially around Bodrum and Fethiye marinas.</li>\n    <li>Ephesus (Efes) near Selçuk is a key draw, often combined with Kuşadası.</li>\n    <li>Çeşme and Alaçatı from Izmir suit those who like windsurfing and narrow stone streets.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For side‑by‑side comparisons, see <a href=\"[INTERNAL_LINK:best-time-to-visit-turkey]\">When to visit Turkey month by month</a> and <a href=\"[INTERNAL_LINK:turkey-itinerary-7-10-days]\">Sample 7–10 day Turkey itineraries</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Transport and Prices: What to Expect</h2>\n\n<h3>Internal Travel Times</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Domestic flights (approx times, excluding airport formalities):</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Istanbul → Antalya: ~1 hr 10–20 mins.</li>\n    <li>Istanbul → Dalaman: ~1 hr 15–25 mins.</li>\n    <li>Istanbul → Bodrum–Milas: ~1 hr 10–15 mins.</li>\n    <li>Istanbul → Izmir: ~1 hr.</li>\n    <li>Istanbul → Kayseri/Nevşehir (Cappadocia): ~1 hr 15–25 mins.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Coaches (approx):</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Istanbul Esenler Otogar → Izmir Otogar: often 8–9 hrs overnight.</li>\n    <li>Izmir → Bodrum: roughly 3.5–4.5 hrs.</li>\n    <li>Antalya → Fethiye via D400: usually 3–4 hrs.</li>\n    <li>Fethiye → Kaş: commonly 2.5–3 hrs with coastal scenery.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Local buses & dolmuş:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Antalya: tram plus buses like <strong>KL08</strong> (Konyaaltı line) and <strong>LC07</strong> towards Lara; pay with AntalyaKart.</li>\n    <li>Fethiye: dolmuş from near Fethiye Otogar to Ölüdeniz, Hisarönü, Çalış Beach.</li>\n    <li>Bodrum: peninsula dolmuş from Bodrum Otogar to Bitez, Gümbet, Gümüşlük, Yalıkavak, Torba.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Typical Costs (Rough Ranges)</h3>\n\n<p>Turkey’s prices move with exchange rates. These are broad indications – always check current figures.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Domestic flights:</strong> often around <strong>£25–£90 one way</strong> between Istanbul and coastal/Cappadocia airports when booked in advance.</li>\n<li><strong>Intercity coaches:</strong> major routes such as Istanbul–Izmir or Antalya–Fethiye are often similar to or cheaper than a mid‑range UK intercity train ticket for a comparable distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Dolmuş/local buses:</strong> fares are normally comparable to or lower than city bus fares in the UK, paid in Turkish lira, sometimes via local cards (e.g. AntalyaKart) or cash.</li>\n<li><strong>Everyday food:</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Casual lokanta (canteen‑style) meals – a hot main, salad and drink – frequently cost less than a typical UK pub meal.</li>\n    <li>Bakery snacks like <strong>simit</strong>, <strong>pide</strong> and local <strong>ekmek</strong> are usually very economical ways to eat on the move.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Visa and entry:</strong> Requirements for UK passport holders can change. Always check official Turkish government and UK Foreign Office websites for the latest visa rules, fees and passport validity guidance.</p>\n\n<h2>Step-by-Step: Designing Your Own Split</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fix month and trip length.</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>July–August: target about <strong>70–80% coast</strong>, 20–30% city.</li>\n    <li>April–May, late Sept–Oct: aim for roughly <strong>50/50</strong> city–coast or city–Cappadocia.</li>\n    <li>Dec–Feb: focus on city + Cappadocia + thermal/snow; treat coast as a quiet backdrop, not a beach holiday.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Choose your city hub.</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Istanbul suits almost every first‑timer, with dense sights and strong flight links.</li>\n    <li>Consider Izmir or Bursa as a second city only if you have 10+ days.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Choose one main coastal region.</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Mediterranean (Antalya, Side, Kaş/Kalkan) for warmer seas and cliffy scenery.</li>\n    <li>Aegean (Bodrum, Fethiye, Kuşadası, Çeşme) for sailing, marinas and easier access to Ephesus.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Check internal flights and buses.</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Look up Istanbul ↔ coast and Istanbul ↔ Kayseri/Nevşehir before committing.</li>\n    <li>Consider open‑jaw UK flights (e.g. into Istanbul, back from Bodrum or Antalya) if available from your airport.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Lock bases, keep day trips flexible.</strong>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Book your city and coast bases; choose Side vs Alanya or Turgutreis vs Bitez later, once you’re on the ground.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n\n<h3>Is one week enough for both Istanbul and the coast?</h3>\n<p>Yes, if you keep it simple: many visitors do 2–3 nights in Istanbul (Sultanahmet or Karaköy for easy transport) and 4–5 nights on the coast, usually via a domestic flight to Antalya, Dalaman or Bodrum–Milas. You will sample both city and sea rather than cover every region.</p>\n\n<h3>Which coast pairs best with Istanbul for a first trip?</h3>\n<p>For a summer beach holiday, many UK travellers choose the Mediterranean coast around Antalya because flights from Istanbul are frequent and seas are usually warm from late spring to mid‑autumn. For a mix of beach and major ruins like Ephesus, the Aegean coast around Izmir, Kuşadası and Selçuk works well.</p>\n\n<h3>Do I need a hire car on the coast?</h3>\n<p>Not necessarily. Antalya, Fethiye and Bodrum Peninsula all have extensive dolmuş networks – for example, Fethiye–Ölüdeniz minibuses and Bodrum Otogar dolmuş to Bitez, Gümüşlük and Yalıkavak. A car is mainly useful if you want to string together remote coves or several regions in a short time.</p>\n\n<h3>How far ahead should I book internal flights?</h3>\n<p>For school holidays, July–August and Turkish public holidays, booking several weeks or months ahead usually gives better fares and times. Outside peak, you can often book closer to departure, but schedules can change, so it is safer to secure key links (for example Istanbul–Antalya or Istanbul–Kayseri) once your international flights are firm.</p>\n\n<script type='application/ld+json'>\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"Is one week enough for both Istanbul and the coast?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"Yes, if you keep it simple: many visitors do 2–3 nights in Istanbul and 4–5 nights on the coast, usually via a domestic flight to Antalya, Dalaman or Bodrum–Milas.
