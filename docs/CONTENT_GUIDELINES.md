# Content Guidelines

## Article Requirements

### Images
Every article published on the platform must adhere to the following image guidelines:

1.  **Minimum Count**: Each article must include **at least 5 distinct images**.
2.  **Cover Image**:
    *   The first image in the metadata (or explicitly marked as cover) must be high-quality.
    *   It should set the tone for the article.
3.  **Relevance**: Images must be relevant to the section they accompany.
4.  **Quality**: Use high-resolution, realistic images. Avoid generic or low-quality stock photos if possible.
5.  **Alt Text**: All images must have descriptive `alt` text for accessibility and SEO.

### Formatting
*   Use `<h2>` and `<h3>` for headings.
*   Keep paragraphs short and readable.
*   Use bullet points for lists.

### Localization
*   Articles should be available in both Turkish and English (if applicable).
*   Slugs should be localized.
